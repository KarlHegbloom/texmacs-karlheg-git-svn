Though TeXmacs tries to emphasize structural edition of document, it
also support visual edition very easily: it is easy to format a
document by inserting multiple whitespace and empty lines.

This plugin modifies the behaviour of the "space" key in text mode to
prevent the user from typing multiple white spaces in a few
situations.
