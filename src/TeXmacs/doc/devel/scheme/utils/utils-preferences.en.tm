  <tmdoc-title|User preferences>

  Preferences are used to store any information you need to keep across
  different runs of <TeXmacs>, like window position and size, active menu
  bars, etc. Internally they are stored in the users home directory as a
  <scheme> list of items like <scm|("name" value)> which therefore has in
  principle no structure. However, a good practice to avoid conflicts is to
  prefix your options by the name of the plugin or module you are creating,
  like in <scm|"gui:help-window-position">.

  The first step in defining a new preference is adding it with
  <scm|define-preferences> and assigning a call-back function to handle
  changes in the preference. This is important for instance in menus, where a
  click on an item simply sets some preference to some value and it's up to
  the call-back to actually take the necessary actions.

    preferences with defaults and call-backs>
  <|explain>
    Each element of <scm-arg|list> is of the form <scm|("somename" value
    notify-procedure)> where <scm|notify-procedure> is a procedure taking two
    arguments like this:

    <scm|(define (notify-procedure property-name value) (do-things))>

      Example
    <|folded-documentation>
      <\session|scheme|default>
        <\input|Scheme] >
          (define (notify-test pref value)

          \ \ (display* "Hey! " pref " changed to " value)(newline))
        </input>

        <\input|Scheme] >
          (define-preferences ("test:pref" #f notify-test))
        </input>

        <\unfolded-io|Scheme] >
          (get-preference "test:pref")
        <|unfolded-io>
          #f
        </unfolded-io>

        <\input|Scheme] >
          (set-preference "test:pref" #t)
        </input>

        <\input|Scheme] >

  <\explain>
    <scm|(set-preference <scm-arg|name> <scm-arg|value>)><explain-synopsis|set
    user preference>
  <|explain>
    Save preference <scm|name> with value <scm|value>. Then call the
    call-back associated to this preference, as defined in
    <scm|define-preferences>.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(append-preference <scm-arg|name>
    <scm-arg|value>)><explain-synopsis|appends a value to the list for a
    preference>
  <|explain>
    This convenience function appends <scm|value> to the list of values of
    preference <scm|name>, or creates a list with one element in case the
    preference didn't exist. The call-back associated to this preference, as
    defined in <scm|define-preferences> is called once the modification is
    done.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(reset-preference <scm-arg|name>)><explain-synopsis|delete user
    preference>
  <|explain>
    Deletes preference <scm|name> from the user preferences.
  </explain>

  <\explain>
    <scm|(get-preference <scm-arg|name>)><explain-synopsis|get user
    preference>
  <|explain>
    Returns the value of preference <scm|name>.
  </explain>
