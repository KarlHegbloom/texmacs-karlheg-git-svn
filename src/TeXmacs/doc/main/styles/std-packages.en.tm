  <tmdoc-title|Standard <TeXmacs> packages>

  First of all, <TeXmacs> provides several packages for customizing the
  behaviour of the standard styles:

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-long-article>>
    This package induces all numbers of environments (theorems, remarks,
    equations, figures, <abbr|etc.>) to be prefixed by the current section
    number. It is usually used in combination with the <tmstyle|article>
    style (for long articles) and the <tmstyle|book> style (for books with
    long chapters).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-europe>>
    By default, <TeXmacs> uses ``American style numbering''. This means that
    the same counter is used for numbering similar environments like theorem
    and proposition. In other words, a remark following ``Theorem 3'' will be
    numbered ``Remark 4''. If you want each environment to have its
    individual counter, then you should enable ``European style numbering'',
    by selecting the <tmpackage|number-europe> package.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|number-us>>
    This package may be used in order to switch back to American style
    numbering in the case when a third parties style file enforces European
    style numbering.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|structured-list>>
    This is an experimental package. By default, items in unnumbered lists or
    enumerations take no arguments and items in descriptions one argument.
    When using the <tmpackage|structured-list> package, they take an optional
    additional argument with the body of the item.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|structured-section>>
    This is an experimental package. By default, sectional tags only take a
    title argument. When using the <tmpackage|structured-section> package,
    they take an optional additional argument with the body of the section.
    Moreover, the environment <markup|rsection> for recursive sections is
    provided.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<tmpackage|varsession>>
    This package may be used in order to obtain an alternative rendering of
    interactive sessions. The rendering is designed to be nice for
    interactive use, although less adequate for printing.
  </explain>

  In addition to these packages, and the many packages for internal use,
  <TeXmacs> also provides a few personal example style packages
  <tmpackage|allouche>, <tmpackage|bpr> and <tmpackage|vdh> and several style
  packages for use in combination with external plug-ins (<tmpackage|axiom>,
  <tmpackage|giac>, <tmpackage|macaulay2>, <abbr|etc.>).
