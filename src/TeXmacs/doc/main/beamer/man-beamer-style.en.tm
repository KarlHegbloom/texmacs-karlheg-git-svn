  <tmdoc-title|Beamer styles>

  In order to start writing a laptop presentation, you should first select
  the <tmstyle|beamer> style using <menu|Document|Style|beamer>. There are
  several main ``themes'' for presentations, such as
  <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Bluish>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer
  theme|Ice>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Metal>,
  <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer theme|Reddish>, <subsubmenu|Document|Beamer
  theme|Ridged paper>, which can be selected from the <menu|Document|Beamer
  theme> menu.

  The presentation style includes the <tmstyle|alt-colors> style package,
  which features the use of colors for mathematical formulas, enunciations,
  etc. Additional customizations of the presentation style are available in
  the <menu|Focus|Preferences> menus for the various tags to which they
  apply. For instance, the rendering of slide titles and theorems can be
  further customized.
