  <expand|tmdoc-title|Developers of <TeXmacs>>

  <\itemize>
    <item>Andrey Grozin has constantly helped us with many issues: interfaces
    to several computer algebra systems, support for Cyrillic, tools for the
    manipulation of dictionaries, etc.

    <item>David Allouche replaced the gencc preprocessor by the more standard
    C++ template system. He also made many other patches, bug reports and he
    did a lot of the administration of TeXmacs.

    <item>Dan Grayson helped me to implement communications with computer
    algebra systems via pipes. He also provided some money support for
    <apply|TeXmacs>, and he made many useful comments and suggestions.

    <item>Karim Belabas designed and developed with me the first protocol for
    interfacing <apply|TeXmacs> with scientific computation or computer
    algebra systems. He also implemented the interface with the Pari system.

    <item>Stéphane Payrard made an important bugfix for destroying windows.

    <item>Gwenael Gabard for some fixes in the <LaTeX> to <TeXmacs>
    converter.

    <item>Felix Breuer for his help on XML support and a donation.

    <item>Igor V. Kovalenko for his help on debugging TeXmacs and a few
    patches.

    <item>Gareth McCaughan made several patches and comments.

    <item>Jonas Lööf for a precise installation procedure on Cygwin.

    <item>Rob Clark made a patch which improves the system time support.
