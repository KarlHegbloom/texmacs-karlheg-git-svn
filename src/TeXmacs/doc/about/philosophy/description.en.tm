  <expand|tmdoc-title|A short description of GNU <TeXmacs>>

  GNU <TeXmacs> is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired by
  <TeX> and GNU <name|Emacs>. The editor allows you to write structured
  documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly
  interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program implements
  high-quality typesetting algorithms and <TeX> fonts, which help you to
  produce professionally looking documents.

  The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated
  formulas, which makes <TeXmacs> suitable as an interface for computer
  algebra systems. <TeXmacs> also supports the <name|Guile>/<name|Scheme>
  extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your
  own extensions to the editor.

  Converters exist for <TeX>/<LaTeX> and they are under development for
  <name|Html>/<name|MathML>/<name|Xml>. In the future, <TeXmacs> is planned
  to evolve towards a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet
  capacities, a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.

  GNU <TeXmacs> is hosted by the <hlink|Centre de Ressources Informatiques de
  Haute Savoie|http://www.cri74.org>, Archamps, France.
