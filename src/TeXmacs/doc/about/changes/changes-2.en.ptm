  <expand|section|Tabular material (0.3.5)>

  The way tabular material is treated has completely changed. It has become
  much easier to edit tables, matrices, equation arrays, etc. Also, many new
  features have been implemented, such as background color, border, padding,
  hyphenation, subtables, etc. However, the upgrading of old tabular material
  might sometimes be erroneous, in which case we invite you to submit a bug
  report.
