  <expand|section|Improved titles (1.0.4.1)>

  From now on, titles of documents are more structured. This makes it
  easier to render the same title information in the appropriate ways
  for different styles. Old-style titles are automatically upgraded,
  but the result is only expected to be correct for documents with
  a single author. For documents with multiple authors, you may have
  to re-enter the title using our new interface.
