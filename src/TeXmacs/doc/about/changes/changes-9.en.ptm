  <expand|section|Improved style sheets and source editing mode (1.0.3.5)>

  We are making it easier for users to edit style sheets. This improvement
  made it necessary to simplify many of the standard <TeXmacs> styles and packages,
  so that it will be easier to customize them. However, if you already designed
  some style files, then this may break some of their features. We mainly
  redesigned the list environments, the section environments and automatic numbering.
  Please report any problems to us.
