  All documentation on the <verbatim|texmacs-doc> site falls under the
  <apply|hyper-link|GNU Free Documentation License|../../../fdl.txt>. If you
  write documentation for <TeXmacs> on this site, then you have to agree that
  it will be distributed under this license too. The copyright notice

  <\expand|quote>
    <verbatim|Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
    document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version
    1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with

  should be specified at the end of <em|each> file. This should be done
  inside the <markup|tmdoc-license> macro, in a similar way as at the end of
  the present document. When automatically generating a printed book from
  several documentation files, this will enable us to include the license
  only once.

  You keep (part of) the copyright of all documentation that you will write
  for <TeXmacs> on the official <verbatim|texmacs-doc> site. When you or
  others make additions to (or modifications in, or translations of) the
  document, then you should add your own name (at an appropriate place,
  usually at the end) to the existing copyright information. The copyright
  notice should be specified using the <markup|tmdoc-copyright> function just
  before the license information at the end of the document. The first
  argument of this function contains a year or a period. Each remaining
  argument indicates one of the copyright holders. When combining (pieces of)
  several documents into another one, you should merge the copyright holders.
  For cover information (on a printed book for instance), you are allowed to
  list only the principal authors, but a complete list should be given at a
  clearly indicated place.
