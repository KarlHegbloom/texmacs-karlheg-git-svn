Using TeX fonts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. GNU TeXmacs has been designed in order to cooporate with
   the TeTeX distribution. The TeTeX distribution comes with
   the programs MakeTeXTFM and MakeTeXPK to generate
   new fonts automatically using MetaFont.
   Furthermore, it provides the utility kpsepath,
   for finding the different directories where TeX fonts have been installed.

2. When starting GNU TeXmacs for the first time, the program examines
   the way your TeX system has been installed. The result of this
   examination is written the file $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/system/TEX_PATHS.
   By default, $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH contains ~/.TeXmacs.
   Whenever you change your TeX system, or if you add new fonts,
   it may be a good idea to remove this file in order to recreate it.
   In the directory $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/fonts/error, you also find
   a trace of all fonts which GNU TeXmacs failed to create.
   When adding new fonts, you should remove all files in this directory.

3. If the user did not install the TeTeX distribution or
   no TeX distribution at all, we provide by default
   a limited set of compiled fonts in $TEXMACS_PATH/data/tfm and
   $TEXMACS_PATH/data/pk. The user may also specify his own paths
   TEX_TFM_PATH and TEX_PK_PATH for .tfm and .pk files
   respectively. GNU TeXmacs uses the following algorithm to find fonts:

    - Look whether the font is in one of directories specified by
      the user paths TEX_TFM_PATH or TEX_PK_PATH.
    - Look whether the font is installed by default in
      $TEXMACS_PATH/data/tfm or $TEXMACS_PATH/data/pk. 
    - Look whether the font was already generated in
      the TeTeX distribution (using kpsepath). 
    - Automatically generate the font using
      MakeTeXTFM and/or MakeTeXPK.

4. We also precompiled a larger set of 600 dpi fonts,
   which can be added to the set of default fonts from 'TeXmacs'.
   In order to do so, first download the fonts from

	ftp://ftp.texmacs.org/pub/TeXmacs/targz/TeXmacs-600pk-fonts.tar.gz

   Next unpack them in the installation directory using

        tar -zxvf TeXmacs-600pk-fonts.tar.gz
