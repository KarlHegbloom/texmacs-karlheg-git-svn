Installation of GNU TeXmacs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Set the environment variables.
   Let [installation directory] be the current directory,
   which contains this file. Depending on your shell, either type

       setenv TEXMACS_PATH [installation directory]
       setenv PATH $TEXMACS_PATH/bin:$PATH
   or
       export TEXMACS_PATH=[installation directory]
       export PATH=$TEXMACS_PATH/bin:$PATH

2. Run 'TeXmacs' using

       texmacs &

3. Be cool and let us know if you like or dislike the program; see

	http://www.texmacs.org

   It is very useful for us to have a rough idea about the number of
   permanent users and for what applications you are interested in TeXmacs.
   Furthermore, we are glad to receive your suggestions and problems,
   no matter how silly they may seem to you. If you really like the program,
   then please consider donating money or services to us; see

Appendix A: Possible problems

    * TeXmacs runs fine, but certain fonts are not displayed correctly.
      Solution: This problem may have several causes:
      o You use a recent version (>= 7.3) of RedHat Linux or
        one of its clones. On such systems, the installation of
        TeTeX is bugged and you need to change some permissions
        in order to allow font generation by Metafont.
        As root, type
	  chmod -R a+rw /var/lib/texmf/*
      o You do not use a standard TeX/LaTeX distribution, such as TeTeX
	(standard distributions come with scripts for generating fonts,
	such as 'mktextfm' or 'MakeTeXTFM'). You may either install
        a more standard TeX/LaTeX distribution, or download some
        pregenerated fonts from texmacs.org.
