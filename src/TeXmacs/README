                Welcome to GNU TeXmacs
             ----------------------------

GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents
via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly interface.
New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality
typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce
professionally looking documents.

The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface
for computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
extension language, so that you may customize the interface and
write your own extensions to the editor.

TeXmacs currently runs on PC's and PPC's under Gnu/linux
(a >200MHz processor and >32Mb of memory are recommended)
and on sun computers. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and
they are under development for Html/Mathml/Xml.
In the future, TeXmacs is planned to evoluate towards
a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet capacities,
a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.
