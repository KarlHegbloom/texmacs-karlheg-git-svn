  <subsection|Introduction to <name|Scilab> software>

  <hlink|<name|Scilab>|http://www.scilab.org> is a free software for
  numerical computation, providing a powerful computing environment for
  engineering and scientific applications.

  <hlink|<name|Scilab>|http://www.scilab.org> includes numerous mathematical
  functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to
  advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions.

  A large number of functionalities is included in
  <hlink|<name|Scilab>|http://www.scilab.org>:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Maths & Simulation: for usual engineering and science applications
    including mathematical operations and data
    analysis.<with|font-series|bold|>

    <item>2-D & 3-D Visualization: graphics functions to visualize, annotate
    and export data and many ways to create and customize various types of
    plots and charts.

    <item>Optimization: algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained
    continuous and discrete optimization problems.

    <item>Statistics: tools to perform data analysis and modeling.

    <item>Control System Design & Analysis: standard algorithms and tools for
    control system study.
