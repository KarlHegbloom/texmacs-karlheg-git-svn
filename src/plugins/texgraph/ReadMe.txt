Plugin TeXgraph (0.4)
---------------------

To have access to TeXgraph session inside TeXmacs, you will have to :

1. Install TeXmacs (see http://www.texmacs.org/).

2. Install TeXgraph (see http://texgraph.tuxfamily.org/). 
   Choose the defaut installation folder(/usr/local/share/TeXgraph/) to have access to the TeXgraph help inside TeXmacs.

3. Unzip texgraph.zip in ~/.TeXmacs/plugins/.


Everything was tested under Ubuntu 8.10 with TeXmacs 1.0.7 and TeXgraph 1.94 beta-7.2

For windows users, you will have to copy the texgraph.sty file (that you can find in the TeXgraph folder) in your TEX arbrescence and update the base.

--------------------
Known problems
--------------------
If the TeXgraph installation directory isn't the default one (/usr/local/share/TeXgraph), the help files won't be accessible from inside TeXmacs.
