To have access to TeXgraph session inside TeXmacs, you will have to :

1. Install TeXmacs (see http://www.texmacs.org/).

2. Install TeXgraph 1.94-beta (voir http://texgraph.forumpro.fr/forum.htm). 
   Choose the defaut installation folder(/usr/local/share/TeXgraph/) to have access to the TeXgraph help inside TeXmacs.

3. Unzip texgraph.zip in ~/.TeXmacs/plugins/.

4. Copy the texgraph_macros_texmacs.mac file in the TeXgraphMac folder or in the installation directory TeXgraph/macros


Everything was tested under Ubuntu 8.10 with TeXmacs 1.0.7 and TeXgraph 1.94 beta-7.2
Under Windows, write the TeXgraph_Directory in your PATH (for that, use the Advanced Tab (Environment Variables) in the System Properties window).
