Plugin TeXgraph (04/10/09)

See the details on http://corcelle.wordpress.com/
---------------------

To have access to TeXgraph session inside TeXmacs, you will have to :

1 Install TeXgraph 1.94-beta (voir http://texgraph.forumpro.fr/forum.htm). 

2. Unzip texgraph.zip in ~/.TeXmacs/plugins/.

3. Copy the texgraph_macros_texmacs.mac file in the TeXgraphMac folder or in the installation directory TeXgraph/macros


Everything was tested under Ubuntu 8.10 with TeXmacs 1.0.7 and TeXgraph 1.94 beta-7.2
Under Windows, write the TeXgraph_Directory in your PATH (for that, use the Advanced Tab (Environment Variables) in the System Properties window).
