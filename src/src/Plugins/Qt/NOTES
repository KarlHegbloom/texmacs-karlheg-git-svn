----------


* Image support is still partial. In particular System/Files/image_files.cpp 
  should be modified to allow the ue of Qt to gather informations on image sizes.
  On Mac we can use the Apple Distiller instead of ghostscript to interpret pdf 
  and ps images. (What about Windows?)
  
* Visibility status of main icon bar does not correctly report in the View menu

* What is the header (e.g. in the message SLOT_HEADER_VISIBILITY) ?
  ---> All widgets above the canvas widget, i.e. the title bar + icon bars.
       Under Mac OS, the header only consists of the icon bars.
