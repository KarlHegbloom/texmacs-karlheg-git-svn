1. Conversion program<->scheme_tree not completely correct:
   Problem with the list () of length zero.

2. Other conversions to trees should be normalized.
   Get rid of () [] {} (,) [,] {,}

3. Indices, color changes, etc.
   -> change environment while typesetting.
   -> but not when executing without typesetting.

4. Possible to distinguish between static and shared compilation
   on sun systems by -dy and -dn flags. However, only a shared
   version of ldl is available...
