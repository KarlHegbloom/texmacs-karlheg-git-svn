Description:  A structured wysiwyg scientific text editor
 GNU TeXmacs (pronounced like "Tek-macs" because the X is really the greek
 letter Î§) is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) user-extendable
 editing and interface platform with special features for academic research
 writers in many fields of endeavor. It is especially well thought of by
 mathematicians, scientists, and educators.
 .
 The software aims to provide a unified and user friendly framework for
 editing structured documents with different types of content (text, graphics,
 mathematics, interactive content, etc.). The rendering engine uses
 high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce professionally looking
 documents, which can either be printed out, presented from a laptop, or
 exported to a PDF, complete with hyperlinks.
 .
 The software includes a rich editor with support for mathematical formulas, a
 small technical picture editor, and a tool for making presentations from a
 laptop. Moreover, TeXmacs can be used as an interface for many external
 systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.
 .
 New presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
 added to the editor using the Scheme extension language. A native spreadsheet
 and tools for collaborative authoring are planned for later.  TeXmacs runs on
 all major Unix platforms and Windows. Documents can be saved in TeXmacs, Xml
 or Scheme format and printed as Postscript or Pdf files. Converters exist for
 TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml.
 .
 (This particular package was produced using the packages/debian setup from
 the primary TeXmacs source distribution. If this binary does not function
 properly on your system, try compiling your own copy, or finding it from a
 PPA or distro maintainer.)
