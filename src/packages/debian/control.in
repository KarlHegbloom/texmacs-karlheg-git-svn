 This is a pre-release development snapshot:

 This binary is built from the 'syrinx' branch of the Github fork at:
 .
 https://github.com/KarlHegbloom/texmacs
 .
 It is not an "official product" of TeXmacs.org. All changes relative to
 the TeXmacs subversion repository are made clearly visible by use of the
 Github interface. All are subject to the same licence as TeXmacs itself.
 .
 GNU TeXmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing
 platform with special features for scientists. The software aims to
 provide a unified and user friendly framework for editing structured
 documents with different types of content (text, graphics,
 mathematics, interactive content, etc.). The rendering engine uses
 high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to produce professionally
 looking documents, which can either be printed out or presented from
 a laptop.
 .
 The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical
 formulas, a small technical picture editor and a tool for making
 presentations from a laptop. Moreover, TeXmacs can be used as an
 interface for many external systems for computer algebra, numerical
 analysis, statistics, etc. New presentation styles can be written by
 the user and new features can be added to the editor using the Scheme
 extension language. A native spreadsheet and tools for collaborative
 authoring are planned for later. TeXmacs runs on all major Unix
 platforms and Windows. Documents can be saved in TeXmacs, Xml or
 Scheme format and printed as Postscript or Pdf files. Converters
 exist for TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml.
