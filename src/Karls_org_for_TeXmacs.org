* TODO Packaging issues needing resolved
  + [ ] General Packaging Issues
    + [ ] Plugins: Ship compiled or as source?
      + [ ] Compiled pros
      + [ ] Compiled console
      + [ ] Source pros
      + [ ] Source cons
    + [ ] Compilability of the plugin code - when compiled in advanced
      + [ ] Installation of build-depends, building of binary package
    + [ ] Compilability of the plugin code - when shipped as source
      + [ ] Documentation of build-depends, inside each plugin Makefile
      + [ ] Install the plugins in /usr/src (or macports equivalent?)
      + [ ] Ensure that they are owned by root:src (or macports equiv)
      + [ ] They need to be able to find ../../src/System/config.h
        and maybe other TeXmacs headers, as well as the headers and
        libraries for anything they are to be linked with.
  + [ ] MacOS Packaging Issues
    + [ ] Common
      + [ ] ~(setenv "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" "/opt/local/lib/guile18")~ was
        necessary in my ~/.guile in order to cause it to successfully
        execute ~(use-modules (ice-9 readline))~.
    + [ ] Macports
      + [ ] Consider use the macports build as basis for the dmg or pkg
        format build. Probably commonly done?
    + [ ] dmg or pkg
      + [ ] Copy in everything needed, fix up for installed location
        There's a script for it that can be improved...
        + [ ] It needs to have a complete Guile 1.8 inside it's own
          directory, down in /Applications/TeXmacs-1.99.5.app/Contents.
  + [ ] Linux Packaging Issues
  + [ ] Windows Packaging Issues


* TODO The ~texmacs~ script does the wrong thing wrt already set TEXMACS_PATH and TEXMACS_BIN_PATH
   When TEXMACS_PATH is set, it resets TEXMACS_BIN_PATH without even
   checking first to see if it has been defined already, i.e., by a
   user shell environment setting, or the .dir-locals.el here for Emacs.


* TODO TeXmacs org mode and outline editting.


* TODO Crash in destructor for tree-pointers

* TODO Port to Guile 2.2

** Link to where Guile 2.2 sets up the module system (in boot-9.scm):
