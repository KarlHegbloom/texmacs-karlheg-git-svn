GENERAL ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

Implement better tools for debugging
  * Mechanism to recover all scheme error messages in a dedicated
    TeXmacs buffer, together with foldable backtraces.
  * Provide correct locations for the "texmacs-error" primitive.
  * Provide a clean exception semantics for all routines in the basic APIs.
  * Clean exception semantics for C++ routines which are exported to Scheme.
  * Emergency saving of modified buffers on fatal_error.
  * Throw-catch mechanism in C++ code when compiling with enable-debug
    and replacement of fatal_error when possible.
  * Test-suite of TeXmacs documents for different features and
    automated checks for certain types of correctness.

Hunt down memory leaks
  * Valgrind
  * Implement marking algorithm

===============================================================================
SCHEME INTERFACE
===============================================================================

Internal plug-in for Guile

Integrate menus in new GUI system

Naming conventions
  * Rename "drd-" -> "logic-" for routines from kernel/drd.
  * Appropriate naming convention for routines which operate on markup:
    when to use tmconcat-, concat-, concat/, tree-concat-, ...,
    especially for tags like "tree" which are also used as data types.

More systematic preservation of locality
  * Replace dispatch tables by contextual overloading where possible
    (i.e. LaTeX export).

===============================================================================
TYPESETTER
===============================================================================

General
  * Equivalent of TEX \topsep
    In TEXMACS, the \topsep always equals 0.75em. It should be possible
    to modify this. For symmetry, we might also introduce a ``bottom sep''.
  * Resizing macro expansions
    When attempting to resize a macro application to become smaller than
    the ``x'', the invisible markers may have undesirable side-effects.
  * Font parameters
    Separate environment variables for ``typewriter'', ``sans serif'',
    ``small caps'', ``slant'', etc.
    Find rendering font as a function of selected font and language.
  * Simplification of page parameters
    Should we still reorganize? It should be easy to access to
    the page width and height and some other parameters.

Text
  * Introduction of the paragraph tag
    Distinguish between paragraphs and paragraph units.
  * Page decorations (headers and footers)
    Should the corresponding environment variables become macros?
  * Fine-grained baseline skip
    Associate baseline skip (or ascent and descent) to each individual box
    in concatenation. Next compute maximum over each line. Take maximum of
    maximum after first line and maximum before second line in order to
    obtain final value. Also for other parameters such as baselineskip?
  * Precise scope of variables which affect paragraph layout.

Mathematics
  * Horizontal grouping instead of \bigop ... \big.
    Introduce grouping primitives in which expressions with big operands
    (and maybe large delimiters) can be encapsulated. The advantage is that
    this eases parsing and an indicative bounding box is shown.
  * Scripts to large delimiters produced by macros
    Such scripts are not put at the right positions
  * Macro for fractions in continued fractions.
  * Less vertical spacing in text style between numerator/denominator and bar.
  * Left-numbering of equation arrays
    Should be possible now using the extern primitive.
  * Consider fractions and scripts as operators
    Consider fractions as operators => spaces before and after.
    Similarly for scripts => small space before left scripts and
    after right scripts.
  * Better spacing
    Determine spacing between two mathematical boxes as a function of
    the rough semantics of the boxes. Application: no need for operators
    like the unary minus.

Style-sheet language
  * Introduce a style options mechanism
    Option -> call back macro which can be enriched by several packages
    Call back macros called at end of reading style files when option selected
    Selected options postpended to name for style-file caching
  * Grey menu entries for parameters which cannot be changed in style
    For instance, a style might provide a limited number of font base sizes.

Boxes
  * Origin of boxes
    Boxes should not have origins; its children should have positions instead.

Current bridges
  * Temporarily inccorect markup
    When pressing A-backspace inside a surround tag, we first remove
    two children of the surround tag (so that it obtains arity 1) and
    next remove the tag itself. The temporarily inccorect surround tag
    of arity 1 may cause bridge_surround to crash.
    Temporary fix: add extra nodes in the bridge.
    Better fix: implement an elementary modification assign_label
    which allows to change the surround tag into another tag like tuple
    before performing incorrect operations.

===============================================================================
EDITOR
===============================================================================

Editing source trees
  * Edit as option
    A facility "Edit as" to convert a selection into any other format and
    put the result in an "edit-as" tag for manual editing. When pressing
    return, reconvert back into TEXMACS.
  * More customizable presentation of source tags
    Make the presentation of source code more customizable by user macros.
    Done for syntactic highlighting, but should also be done for special
    rendering of certain primitives and the rendering of tags.
  * Primitive for block arguments
    Currently, we may stretch tags. We also need a primitive for stretching
    tag arguments.
  * Comments
    Tags for short commands inside the program
  * Visual hints
    Display informative flags at places where tags have been stretched or
    a modification to the source style has been applied

===============================================================================
TOOLS AND FREQUENTLY USED SUBROUTINES
===============================================================================

Quoting
  * Implement different routines for quoting and quote/unquote
    using the appropriate routine.

General caching mechanism
  * Optimize performance as a function of cost of recomputation and
    storage requirement

LATEX import
  * Avoid name-clashes with built-in commands
    Importation of LATEX macros whose names coincide with built-in
    commands may lead to incorrect documents (e.g. the point macro
    in publs/1998/zeta.tex). We should probably post-correct imported
    documents.
  * Better parsing of verbatim arguments
    Some commands, like cite, documentclass, etc. take verbatim arguments,
    which should not be parsed in the generic way. The string_arg function
    is a temporary remedy.

===============================================================================
MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
===============================================================================

Publicity

Mirror sites
  * CVS mirror at Savannah and automatic update scheme.
  * Also search for other mirror sites (increases availability and
    visibility on the web).
