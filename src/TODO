This file contains points for which I did not have time yet during
the reorganization of TeXmacs, as a function of the category.
It is mainly meant as a reminder for myself, but any help is appreciated.

Editing style files
-------------------

  * A facility "Edit as" to convert a selection into any other format and
    put the result in an "edit-as" tag for manual editing. When pressing
    return, reconvert back into TeXmacs.

  * Make the presentation of source code more customizable by user macros.
    Done for syntactic highlighting, but should also be done for special
    rendering of certain primitives and the rendering of tags.

  * A primitive for marking arguments as being blocks.

  * The way page parameters are specified is a big mess. Write a method
    "update_page_pars" in edit_env for computing the page parameters
    from the environment. This routine should be called at the beginning
    of the typesetting and after each new_page instruction.

  * The markup for specifying titles, authors, addresses, etc.
    is not very adequate for papers with several authors.
    Redesign all this and maybe rely on scheme routines via "extern"
    for the typesetting.

  * Complete the documentation on how to write style files and
    the TeXmacs primitives.
