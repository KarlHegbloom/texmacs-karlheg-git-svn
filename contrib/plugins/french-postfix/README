TeXmacs provides several built-in shortcuts to type in accented
characters on keyboards which do not have the appropriate keys. But
those shortcuts are too clumsy for ordinary use.

This plugin provides several shortcuts in french language context. The
shortcuts are inspired from emacs "french-postfix" input method and
make it easy to type french text on a QWERTY keyboard.

A few of the provided shortcuts:
  [A `]    A grave
  [e ']    e acute
  [o e]    oe ligature
  [o e e]  oe as two letters
  [c ,]    c cedille
  [c , ,]  letter c followed by comma
