Summary: library module providing a better interactive procedure

TeXmacs provides a built-in glue procedure called "interactive" which
implements user interation in the minibuffer (footer). However this
function was not updated during the Scheme layer refactoring and
depends on a callback procedure to be accessible in the top-level
namespace.

This plugins provides wrappers around "interactive" which use a
closure callback (instead of a symbol) and can provide a default
value.

It is not useful to the user by itself, but other modules depend on
it.
