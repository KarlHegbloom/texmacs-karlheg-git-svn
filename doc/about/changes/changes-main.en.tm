  <tmdoc-title|Important changes in <TeXmacs>>

  Below, we briefly describe the most important changes which have occurred
  in <TeXmacs> since version 0.3.3.15. We also maintain a more detailed
  <hyper-link|change log|change-log.en.tm>.

  In general, when upgrading to a new version, we recommend you to make
  backups of your old <TeXmacs> files before opening them with the newer
  version of <TeXmacs>. In the unlikely case when your old file does not open
  in the correct way, please send a bug report to

  <\verbatim>
    \ \ \ \ bugs@texmacs.org
  </verbatim>

  and send your old document as an attached file. Do not forget to mention
  your version of <TeXmacs> and the system you are using.
