  <expand|section|Formatting tags (1.0.2 -- 1.0.2.1)>

  All formattings constructs without arguments (like line breaks,
  indentation directives, etc.) have been replaced by tags of arity zero.
  This makes most new documents badly unreadable for older versions
  of <TeXmacs> and subtle errors might occasionnaly occur when saving
  or loading, or during other editing operations.
