  <tmdoc-title|Other things we are working on>

  Even though our main focus is on the stabilization of <TeXmacs> and to make
  it more suitable for developers, we intend to continue some time on the
  development on new features. A few points currently have our priority:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Further development of the graphical drawing mode. First, the
    upcoming support of <hlink|<name|Cairo>|http://cairographics.org/>,
    <hlink|<name|OpenGL>|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL>, <abbr|etc.>
    should improve the rendering quality. Secondly, we intend to allow the
    user to create new macros, either by explicit constructions or
    constrained-based constructions. Finally, we would like to incorporate
    several features which are typically found in editors of vector graphics,
    such as <hlink|<name|Inkscape>|http://www.inkscape.org/>.

    <item>Extended features for computer algebra sessions, such as automatic
    folding of large expressions, lazy output (with subexpressions which can
    be further evaluated by clicking on them), cas-aided writing, etc.

    <item>Providing more semantics to mathematical formulas by providing a
    simple way to construct parsers and pretty printers and to use them for
    establishing a bijection between presentation and content markup for
    certain well-defined languages.

    <item>Continue the development of remote <TeXmacs> servers for providing
    web-based services in combination with <TeXmacs>. These services comprise
    chatting (with mathematical formulas) and collaborative authoring.

    <item>Development of universal spreadsheet tools, which can be connected
    to any external plug-in for doing the computations. In a similar vein,
    external plug-ins might be used to draw graphs of functions in the
    graphical mode.
