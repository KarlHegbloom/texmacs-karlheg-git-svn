  <tmdoc-title|A short description of GNU <TeXmacs>>

  GNU <TeXmacs> is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired by
  <TeX> and GNU <name|Emacs>. The editor allows you to write structured
  documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly
  interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program implements
  high-quality typesetting algorithms and <TeX> fonts, which help you to
  produce professionally looking documents.

  The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated
  formulas, which makes <TeXmacs> suitable as an interface for computer
  algebra systems. <TeXmacs> also supports the <name|Guile>/<name|Scheme>
  extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your
  own extensions to the editor.

  Converters exist for <TeX>/<LaTeX>, <name|Html>/<name|MathML> and
  <name|Xml>. In the future, <TeXmacs> is planned to evolve towards a
  complete scientific office suite. A rudimentary technical drawing editor
  and presentation mode are already included. A spreadsheet and tools for
  collaborative authoring are planned for later.

  GNU <TeXmacs> is hosted by the <hlink|Centre de Ressources Informatiques de
  Haute Savoie|http://www.cri74.org>, Archamps, France.
