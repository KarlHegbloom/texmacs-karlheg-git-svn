  <tmdoc-title|<value|scheme> serialization>

  Users may write their own extensions to <TeXmacs> in the <value|scheme>
  extension language. In that context, <TeXmacs> trees are usually
  represented by <value|scheme> expressions. The <value|scheme> syntax was
  designed to be predictable, easy to hand-edit, and expose the complete
  internal structure of the document. For instance, the formula
  (<reference|tm-tree-ex>) is represented by

  <\tm-fragment>
    <verbatim|(with "mode" "math" (concat "x+y+" (frac "1" "2") "+" (sqrt
    "y+z")))>
  </tm-fragment>

  The <value|scheme> representation may also be useful in order to represent
  complex macros with a lot of programmic content. Finally, <value|scheme> is
  the safest format when incorporating <TeXmacs> snippets into emails.
  Indeed, both the standard <TeXmacs> format and the XML serialization may be
  quite sensitive to white-space.

  In order to save or load a document in <value|scheme> format, you may use
  <menu|File|Export|Scheme> <abbr|resp.> <menu|File|Import|Scheme>. Files
  saved in <value|scheme> format can easily be processed by external
  <value|scheme> programs, in the same way as files saved in XML format can
  easily be processed by tools for processing XML, like XSLT.

  In order to copy a document fragment to an email in <value|scheme> format,
  you may use <menu|Edit|Copy to|Scheme>. Similarly, you may paste external
  <value|scheme> fragments into <TeXmacs> using <menu|Edit|Paste
  from|Scheme>. The <value|scheme> format may also used interactively inside
  <value|scheme> sessions or interactive commands. For instance, typing
  <key|M-x> followed by the interactive command

  <\scheme-fragment>
    (insert '(frac "1" "2"))
  </scheme-fragment>

  inserts the fraction <frac|1|2> at the current cursor position.
