  <expand|tmdoc-title|Floating objects>

  Floating objects are allowed to move on the page independently from the
  main text. Usually they contain figures or tables which are too large to
  nicely fit into the main text. A floating object may be inserted using
  <subsubmenu|Insert|page insertion|floating object>.

  You may also create a floating object and directly insert a figure or table
  inside it using <subsubmenu|Insert|page insertion|floating figure> resp.
  <subsubmenu|Insert|page insertion|floating table>. However, sometimes you
  might want to insert several smaller figures or tables inside one floating
  object. You may do this using <subsubmenu|Insert|image|small figure> resp.
  <subsubmenu|Insert|table|small table>.

  After creating a floating object, you may control its position using
  <submenu|Insert|position float> (when inside the float). You may specify
  whether you allow the floating object to appear at the top of the page, at
  the bottom, directly in the text, or on the next page. By default, the
  float may appear everywhere. However, a floating object will never appear
  inside the main text at less than three lines from the bottom or the top of
  a page.
