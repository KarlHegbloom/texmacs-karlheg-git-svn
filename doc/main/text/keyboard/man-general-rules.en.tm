  <tmdoc-title|General prefix rules>

  Since there are many keyboard shortcuts, it is important to have some ways
  of classifying them in several categories, in order to make it easier to
  memorize them. As a general rule, keyboard shortcuts which fall in the same
  category are identified by a common prefix. The main such common prefixes
  are:

  <\description>
    <item*|<key|C-<with|mode|math|x>>>Control key based shortcuts are used
    for frequently used editing commands. They depend very much on the ``look
    and feel'' in <menu|Edit|Preferences>. For instance, if you use an
    <name|Emacs>-compatible look and feel, then the shortcuts of the form
    <key|C-<with|mode|math|x>> correspond to <name|Emacs> commands, like
    <key|C-y> for pasting text.

    <item*|<key|A-<with|mode|math|x>>>The alternate key is used for commands
    which depend on the mode that you are in. For instance, <kbd-text|s>
    produces <strong|strong> text in text mode and a square root
    <with|mode|math|<sqrt|>> in math mode. Notice that <key|escape
    escape> is equivalent to <key|A->.

    <item*|<key|M-<with|mode|math|x>>>The meta key is used for general
    purpose <TeXmacs> commands, which can be used in all modes. For instance,
    <kbd-gen|!> produces a label. It is also used for additional editing
    commands, like <key|A-w> for copying text if you use the <name|Emacs>
    look and feel. Notice that <key|escape> is equivalent to <key|M->.

    <item*|<key|H-<with|mode|math|x>>>The user keyboard modifier key is used
    for producing special symbols like Greek characters in math mode. You may
    configure your keyboard so as to let caps-lock play the rôle of the hyper
    key. The <shortcut|math:greek> is equivalent to <key|H->.
  </description>

  We recall that the particular modifier keys which are used in order to
  obtain the <key|M-> and <key|H-> prefixes can be
  <hyper-link|configured|../../config/man-config-kbd-modkeys.en.tm> in
  <menu|Edit|Preferences>.
