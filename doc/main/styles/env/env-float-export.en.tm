  <tmdoc-title|Using the environments for floating objects>

  The <tmdtd|env-float> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides the following environments for
  floating objects:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces an inline figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body
    and <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Inline figures may for instance be
    used to typeset several small figures side by side inside a floating
    object.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces a big figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body and
    <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Big figures span over the whole paragraph
    width.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|small-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|big-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|footnote|body>>
    Produces a footnote.
  </explain>

  The figure-like environments also admit \ unnumbered versions
  <markup|small-figure*>, <markup|big-figure*>, <abbr|etc.>, which are
  obtained using <shortcut|(toggle-number)>.
