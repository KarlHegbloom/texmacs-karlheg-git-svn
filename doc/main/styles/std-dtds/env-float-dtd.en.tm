  <tmdoc-title|Environments for floating objects>

  The <tmdtd|env-float> <abbr|d.t.d.> provides the following environments for
  floating objects:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces an inline figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body
    and <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Inline figures may for instance be
    used to typeset several small figures side by side inside a floating
    object.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-figure|body|caption>>
    This macro produces a big figure with <src-arg|body> as its main body and
    <src-arg|caption> as a caption. Big figures span over the whole paragraph
    width.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|small-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|small-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|big-table|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|big-figure>, but for tables.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|footnote|body>>
    Produces a footnote.
  </explain>

  The figure-like environments also admit \ unnumbered versions
  <markup|small-figure*>, <markup|big-figure*>, <abbr|etc.>, which are
  obtained using <key|A-*>.

  The following macros can be used for customizing the rendering of
  figure-like environments:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-small-figure|aux|name|body|caption>>
    This macro is used for rendering small figure-like environments. The
    first argument <src-arg|aux> specifies an auxiliary channel (like
    ``figure'' or ``table'') which is used for inserting the caption inside
    the list of figures. The second argument <src-arg|name> specifies the
    name of the figure (like ``Figure 2.3'' or ``Table <no-break>5''). The
    last arguments <src-arg|body> and <src-arg|caption> correspond to the
    figure itself and a caption.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|render-big-figure|aux|name|body|caption>>
    Similar to <markup|render-small-figure>, but for displaying a big
    figure-like environments.
  </explain>

  The following tags can be used for customizing the appearance the text
  around figures, tables and footnotes:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|figure-name|name>>
    This macro controls the appearance of the text ``Figure''. By default, we
    use bold face.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|figure-sep>>
    This macro produces the separator between the figure and its number and
    the caption. By default, it produces a period followed by a space.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|footnote-sep>>
    This macro produces the separator between the number of the footnote and
    the text. By default, it produces a period followed by a space.
  </explain>
