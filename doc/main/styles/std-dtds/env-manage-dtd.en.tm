  <tmdoc-title|Defining new environments>

  The <tmdtd|env-base> <abbr|d.t.d.> contains high-level markup which can be
  used by the user to define new environments for theorems, remarks,
  exercises and figures:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-theorem|env-name|display-name>>
    This meta-macro is used for defining new theorem-like environments. The
    first argument <src-arg|env-name> specifies the name for the environment
    (like ``experiment'') and <src-arg|display-name> the corresponding text
    (like ``Experiment''). When defining a new theorem-like environment like
    <markup|experiment>, an unnumbered variant <markup|experiment*> is
    automatically defined as well.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-remark|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for remarks.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-exercise|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for exercises.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|new-exercise|env-name|display-name>>
    Similar as <markup|new-theorem>, but for figures. When defining a new
    type of figure, like ``picture'', the <markup|new-figure> macro defines
    both the inline environment <markup|small-picture> and the
    block-environment <markup|big-picture>, as well as the unnumbered
    variants <markup|small-picture*> and <markup|big-picture*>.
  </explain>

  The theorem-like and remark-like environments belong to a common
  counter-group <verbatim|theorem-env>. By default, we use American-style
  numbering (one common counter for all environments). When selecting the
  package <tmpackage|number-europe>, each environment uses its own counter.
  All exercises and figures use their own counter-group.

  More generally, the <verbatim|std-env> counter-group regroups the counters
  for all standard <TeXmacs> environments. Typically, all counters in this
  group are prefixed in a similar way (for instance by the number of the
  chapter). Figure <reference|std-env-fig> shows how the hierarchical
  organization of this counter group.

  <\big-figure|<tree|<verbatim|std-env>|<tree|<verbatim|theorem-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|theorem>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|proposition>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|remark>>>|<row|<cell|<with|mode|math|\<vdots\>>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|exercise-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|exercise>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|problem>>>>>>>|<tree|<verbatim|figure-env>|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|<verbatim|figure>>>|<row|<cell|<verbatim|table>>>>>>>|<verbatim|equation>|<verbatim|footnote>>>
    <label|std-env-fig>Organization of the counters for the standard
    <TeXmacs> environments.
  </big-figure>

  New unary environments may be added to arbitrary counter-groups using the
  <markup|new-env> macro. In addition to the arguments of
  <markup|new-theorem>, this macro takes a counter-group and the name of a
  binary macro for rendering the environment on input. The arguments of the
  rendering macro are a name (like ``Theorem 3.14'') and its body. For
  instance, <markup|new-theorem> is based on <markup|new-env>, by taking
  <verbatim|theorem-env> for the counter-group and <markup|render-theorem>
  for the rendering macro.

  We recall trat you may add new counters or counter-groups to the
  <verbatim|theorem-env> counter-group using the <markup|new-counter-group>
  and <markup|add-to-counter-group> macros, as described in the section about
  counters.
