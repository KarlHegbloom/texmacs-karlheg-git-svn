  <tmdoc-title|Standard lists>

  The standard <TeXmacs> lists are defined in <tmdtd|std-list>. The
  unnumbered lists environments are:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize|body>>
    The tag before each item depends on the nesting depth.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-minus|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|-> for the tag.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-dot|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|\<bullet\>> for the tag.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|itemize-arrow|body>>
    Uses <with|mode|math|\<rightarrow\>> for the tag.
  </explain>

  The following environments can be used for producing numbered lists:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate|body>>
    The kind of number before each item depends on the nesting depth.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-numeric|body>>
    Number the items by 1, 2, 3, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-roman|body>>
    Number the items by i, ii, iii, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-Roman|body>>
    Number the items by I, II, III, <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-alpha|body>>
    Number the items by a), b), c), <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|enumerate-Alpha|body>>
    Number the items by A), B), C), <abbr|etc.>
  </explain>

  The following environments can be used for descriptive lists:

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description|body>>
    The environment for default descriptive lists (usually
    <markup|description-compact>).
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-compact|body>>
    Align the left hand sides of the items in the list and put their
    descriptions shortly behind it.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-dash|body>>
    Similar to <markup|description-compact>, but use a  to seperate each
    item from its description.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-align|body>>
    Align the left hand sides of the descriptions, while aligning the items
    to the right.
  </explain>

  <\explain|<explain-macro|description-long|body>>
    Put the items and their descriptions on distinct lines.
  </explain>

  New items in a list are indicated through the <markup|item> tag or the
  <markup|item*> tag in the case of descriptions. The <markup|item> tag takes
  no arguments and the <markup|item*> tag one argument. When using the
  experimental <tmdtd|structured-list> package, these tags may take an
  optional body argument. In the future, all list items should become
  structured.

  By default, items in sublists are numbered in the same way as usual lists.
  Each list environment <markup|<em|list>> admits a variant
  <markup|<em|list>*> whose items are prefixed by the last item in the parent
  list. Of course, this feature can be used recursively.

  The <tmdtd|std-list> also contains additional macros for defining new lists
  and for customizing the appearance of standard list items and the lists
  themselves.
