  <tmdoc-title|Editing sessions>

  Inside input fields of sessions, the cursor keys have a special meaning:
  when moving upwards or downwards, you will move to previous or subsequent
  input fields. When moving to the left or to the right, you will never leave
  the input field; you should rather use the mouse for this.

  Some facilities for editing input, output and text fields are available in
  the <menu|Session|Field> menu. Keyboard shortcuts for inserting fields are
  <shortcut|(structured-insert-up)> (insert above) and <shortcut|(structured-insert-down)>. Keyboard shortcuts
  for removing matching text/input/output fields are <shortcut|(structured-remove #f)>
  (remove backwards) and <shortcut|(structured-remove #t)> (remove current fields).

  It is possible to create ``subsessions'' using <menu|Session|Session|Create
  subsession> or <shortcut|(structured-insert #t)>. In that case, the current input-output
  field becomes the body of an unfolded subsession. Such a subsession
  consists of an explanatory text together with the subsession body.
  Subsessions can be folded and unfolded using <shortcut|(fold)>
  <abbr|resp.> <shortcut|(unfold)>. Subsessions have a nice rendering on the
  screen when using the <tmpackage|varsession> package in <menu|Document|Use
  package|Program>.

  Other useful editing operations are <menu|Session|Session|Clear all
  fields>, which is useful for creating a demo session which will be executed
  later on, and <menu|Session|Split session>, which can be used for splitting
  a session into parts for inclusion into a paper.
