  <expand|tmdoc-title|Generating an index>

  For the generation of an index, you first have to put index entries in your
  document using <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry>. At a second stage, you
  must put your cursor at the place where you want your index to be generated
  and click on <apply|menu|Text|Automatic|Index>. The index is than generated
  in a similar way as the table of contents.

  In the <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry> menu, you find several types of
  index entries. The simplest are ``main'', ``sub'', ``subsub'', which are
  macros with one, two and three arguments respectively. Entries of the form
  ``sub'' and ``subsub'' may be used to subordinate index entries with
  respect to other ones.

  A complex index entry takes four arguments. The first one is a key how the
  entry has to be sorted and it must be a ``tuple'' (created using
  <key|inactive \<less\>>) whose first component is the main category, the
  second a subcategory, etc. The second argument of a complex index entry is
  either blank or ``strong'', in which case the page number of your entry
  will appear in a bold typeface. The third argument is usually blank, but if
  you create two index entries with the same non-blank third argument, then
  this will create a ``range'' of page numbers. The fourth argument, which is
  again a tuple, is the entry itself.

  It is also possible to create an index line without a page number using
  ``interject'' in <apply|menu|Insert|Link|Index entry>. The first argument
  of this macro is a key for how to sort the index line. The second argument
  contains the actual text. This construct may be useful for creating
  different sections ``A'', ``B'', etc. in your index.
