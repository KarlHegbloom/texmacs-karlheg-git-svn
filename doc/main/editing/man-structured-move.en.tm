  <tmdoc-title|Structured cursor movement>

  <TeXmacs> implements the three main mechanisms for <em|structured cursor
  movement>:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>Traversal of the entire structure of the document.

    <item>Traversal of tags which are similar to the innermost tag.

    <item>Movements inside the innermost tag.
  </enumerate>

  Most keyboard shortcuts for structured cursor movements can be used in
  combination with the<nbsp><prefix|S->-key so as to similtaneously select
  text while moving around.

  <todo|customizing the behaviour>

  <paragraph*|Structured traversal of the document>

  The <shortcut|(traverse-left)>, <shortcut|(traverse-right)>,
  <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and <shortcut|(traverse-down)> keys are used for
  the structured traversal of the entire document. Inside plain text,
  <shortcut|(traverse-left)> and <shortcut|(traverse-right)> allow you to
  move in a word-by-word manner, while <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-down)> correspond to paragraph-by-paragraph motion.

  In the presence of other markup, the <shortcut|(traverse-left)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-right)> keys allow you to visit all accessible cursor
  positions of the document, except that we keep moving in a word-by-word
  manner inside plain text. The behaviour of the <shortcut|(traverse-up)> and
  <shortcut|(traverse-down)> keys is more context-dependent. Inside matrices,
  they typically allow you to move one row up or down.

  <paragraph*|Traversal of tags which are similar to the innermost tag>

  This type of cursor movement allows you to quickly visit all other tags in
  the document which are <em|similar> to the innermost tag. The
  <shortcut|(traverse-previous)> and <shortcut|(traverse-next)> keys allow
  you move to the previous or next similar tags, whereas
  <shortcut|(traverse-first)> and <shortcut|(traverse-last)> directly jump to
  the first or last similar tags.

  For instance, when you are inside a section title, you may move to the
  previous sectional title (which could also be the title of a subsection or
  a chapter, for instance) using <shortcut|(traverse-previous)>. Notice that
  you may use <key|C-Ÿ> to jump to the previous section title.

  <paragraph*|Movements inside the innermost tag>

  It is also possible to quickly move inside the innermost tag without
  quitting it. The shortcuts <shortcut|(structured-left)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-right)>, <shortcut|(structured-first)> and
  <shortcut|(structured-last)> provide a way to move to the previous, next,
  first or last argument of the innermost tag. Furthermore, the shortcuts
  <shortcut|(structured-exit-left)> and <shortcut|(structured-exit-right)>
  may be used to exit the innermost tag on the left or on the right.

  This default behaviour may be overridden in special contexts. For instance,
  inside tables or trees, they rather correspond to cell-by-cell or
  node-by-node cursor movement. In addition, these cases associate vertical
  cursor movements to <shortcut|(structured-up)>,
  <shortcut|(structured-down)>, <shortcut|(structured-top)>
  and<nbsp><shortcut|(structured-bottom)>.
