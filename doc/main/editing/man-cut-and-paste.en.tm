  <tmdoc-title|Cut and paste>

  You can select text and formulas by maintaining the left mouse button. In
  order to delete the selected region, use <menu|Edit|Cut>. In order to copy
  the selected region, first click on <menu|Edit|Copy>. Next, paste it as
  many times as you want to the location of your cursor, using
  <menu|Edit|Paste>. Alternatively, you may copy a selected region using the
  middle mouse button.

  It is also possible to the change text properties of a selected region. For
  instance, in order to transform some black text in red, you select it using
  the left mouse button and click on <menu|Text|Color|Red>. Similarly, if you
  select a formula and you click on <menu|Insert|Mathematics|Fraction>, then
  the formula becomes the numerator of some fraction.

  When using the copy and paste mechanism to communicate with other
  applications, text is copied and pasted using the <TeXmacs> data format.
  You may specify other import and export formats using <menu|Edit|Import>
  resp. <menu|Edit|Export>. By default, copying and pasting uses the primary
  text buffer. Using <menu|Edit|Copy to> and <menu|Edit|Paste from>, you may
  specify as many other buffers as you like.

  There are two ways to make selections using the keyboard. When using the
  cursor keys <key|left>, <key|right>, <abbr|etc.> while holding
  down the <prefix|S-> button, you may select text while moving around
  the cursor. Alternatively, you may press <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> once to fix a
  starting position. When moving around using the cursor keys, the text
  between the starting position and the current position keeps being
  selected. The selection gets cleared when pressing <shortcut|(selection-cancel)>.

  Notice that the <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> shortcut also allows you to make
  <em|structured selections>. You may select the current word you are in by
  pressing<nbsp><shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> twice. Each additional time you press
  <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> results in the selection of the smallest structure
  which englobes the current selection. Ultimately, when the entire document
  gets selected, pressing <shortcut|(kbd-select-enlarge)> once more clears the selection.
