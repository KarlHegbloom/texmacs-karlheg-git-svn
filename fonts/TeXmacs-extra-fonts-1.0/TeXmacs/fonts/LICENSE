The Type 1 fonts in this directory tree were generated from the corresponding
LaTeX fonts using the 'autotrace' program. All fonts fall under the LaTeX
Project Public License (see the file LATEX_LICENSE).

The original fonts can be downloaded from CTAN (http://www.ctan.org).
Except for the extension, all file names are the same. For instance,
the file ecrm12.pfb was generated from ecrm12.mf.
